# MATLAB FCA Exercises

This repository is developed by the [Automatic Control Group (ACG)](http://www.automatica.unisa.it/), Department of Information Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Applied Mathematics (DIEM), University of Salerno, as part of the coursework for the bachelor course on Automatic Control.

## Contents

This repository contains exercises in MATLAB (coded as *live scripts* or *simulink systems*) to get acquainted with the following functionalities and topics:

* Laplace transform and inverse transform
* State-space systems
* Step responses
* Persistent sinusoid responses
* Block schemes as compositions of subsystems

### Functions

Utility functions are stored in the folder [`functions`](./functions/).
Please refer to the functions' documentation to know their input, output, usage and implementation.

### Scripts

The exercises are stored in the folder [`live_scripts`](./live_scripts/).
Reports in PDF format are stored in the folder [`live_scripts/exports`](./live_scripts/exports).
Please refer to the [`live_scripts` documentation](./live_scripts/README.md)

### Simulink

Simulink models are stored in the folder [`simulink`](./simulink/), together with their drawings in PDF format in the subfolder [`simulink/exports`](./simulink/exports/) and easy scripts to plot the outputs.
Custom subsytems models are defined in [`simulink/models`](./simulink/models/), with images saved in [`simulink/assets`](./simulink/assets/).
Please refer to the [`simulink` documentation](./simulink/README.md) for additional information.

## Requirements

### Operating systems

The exercises are tested under Matlab R2022a and R2023a, in Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04, and Windows 10.

Please do not use MATLAB online.

### Toolboxes

The following toolboxes are required:

* [Symbolic Math Toolbox](https://it.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/)
* [Control System Toolbox](https://it.mathworks.com/products/control.html)
* [Simulink](https://it.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html)
